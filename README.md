# 🚀 Front-end Specialist Test

Greetings newcomer!

How about create some code for us?

In this test you should follow these rules to be succeeded:

## 📋 The Challenge

You are tasked with building a small front-end application that gets mock data and displays a list of issues. The application should allow users to:

- View the list of issues
- Select an issue using a checkbox
- Should display a counter of selected issues
- Should prevent the selection and apply desired style when the issue is resolved
- The summary checkbox on the table header should either check all or uncheck all.
- The summary checkbox should be indeterminate if just some of the issues are selected.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Use **React** (with hooks)
- Use **TypeScript**
- Use all your creativity ;D

## 🧪 The prototype
