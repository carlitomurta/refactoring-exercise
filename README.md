# ðŸš€ Front-end Specialist Test

Greetings newcomer!

How about create some code for us?

In this test you should follow these rules to be succeeded:

## ðŸ“‹ The Challenge

You are tasked with building a small front-end application that gets mock data and displays a list of issues. The application should allow users to:

- View the list of issues
- Select an issue using a checkbox
- Should display a counter of selected issues
- Should prevent the selection and apply desired style when the issue is resolved
- The summary checkbox on the table header should either check all or uncheck all.
- The summary checkbox should be indeterminate if just some of the issues are selected.

## ðŸ“‹ The Prototype

## ðŸ’¡ Tips

- Think about component structure early
- Write readable and reusable code
- Use your clean code and SOLID principles knowledge (if you know)
- Have fun and show us your style! ðŸŽ¨

## ðŸ™Œ Good Luck!
